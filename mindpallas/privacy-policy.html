<h1>Privacy Policy</h1> <p>
              Azhar Jamal built the MindPallas app as
              a Freemium app.
            </p> <p>
            <h3>We do not store any data you add to the app.</h3>
            Not the notes you write or even the books you read. This is all held on your device. It's that simple.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong></p>
            <p>
            MindPallas does not ask for your name, phone number, email or any other personally identifiable data. So even if Justin Bieber [1] asked to see your data, there’s nothing we could do, nothing we could show him.
            </p>
            <p>
            There is a link in the app to a Google Form that is used to allow you to suggest a Patron to us if you fancy. In this form, there is an optional field to add an email address that is used solely to notify you if your suggestion has been taken on and is being introduced within the app. <br>
            This is linked only to your Patron suggestion. It is <strong>NOT</strong> linked to your MindPallas data or usage in any way.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
            <p>
            We like our Privacy Policy as it is but it may change over time with the introduction of new features [2]. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
            </p>
            <p>
            If the change is deemed to be significant, you will also be notified within the MindPallas app.
            </p>
            <p>This policy is effective as of 2020-01-15</p>
